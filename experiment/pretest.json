      "question": "An electrolytic cell:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Has a non-spontaneous chemical reaction",
        "b": "Requires application of a negative potential to make the reaction occur",
        "c": "Has a positively charged anode",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, but not complete. This is part of the characteristics of an electrolytic cell.",
        "b": "Correct, but not complete. A negative potential is required to drive the reaction.",
        "c": "Partially true, but not the complete defining feature.",
        "d": "Correct. All options A and B are true for an electrolytic cell."

      "question": "If we pass a current of 10.0 Amperes through a solution for 1 hour, how many moles of electrons are used?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "10 x 1 x 3600 / 96487",
        "b": "10 x 1 x 3600",
        "c": "10 x 1 x 3600 x 96487",
        "d": "10 x 1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Charge in coulombs divided by Faraday’s constant gives moles of electrons.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This gives the charge in coulombs, not the moles.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would give an incorrect and large value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This gives the total ampere-hours, not moles."

      "question": "The REDOX reaction Zn(s) + Cu²⁺(aq) = Zn²⁺(aq) + Cu(s) has E° = +1.10 V. The standard free energy for this reaction can be calculated as.....",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ΔG° = 2 (96487) (1.10) J/mol",
        "b": "ΔG° = - 3 (96487) (1.10) J/mol",
        "c": "ΔG° = 96487 (1.10) J/mol",
        "d": "ΔG° = - 96487 (1.10) J/mol"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The sign is wrong. It should be negative as the reaction is spontaneous.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The number of electrons is 2, not 3.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The sign is wrong and n is missing.",
        "d": "Incorrect. n=1 is incorrect for this reaction.",
        "e": "Correct. ΔG° = –nFE° = –2×96487×1.10 J/mol."

        "a": "H₂S",
        "b": "H₂",
        "c": "O₂",
        "d": "H₂O"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Hydrogen sulfide is not a product of standard fuel cells.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Hydrogen is a reactant, not a product.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Oxygen is also a reactant.",
        "d": "Correct. The product of hydrogen and oxygen fuel cell is water (H₂O)."

      "question": "The electric charge or electrode deposition of one gram equivalent of a substance is .....",
      "answers": {
        "a": "96,500 coulombs per second",
        "b": "charge on one mole of electrons",
        "c": "one ampere for one second",
        "d": "one ampere for one hour"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a rate, not a total charge.",
        "b": "Correct. One gram equivalent corresponds to one Faraday, which is the charge on one mole of electrons.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That’s just one coulomb.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That’s 3600 coulombs, not one Faraday."
