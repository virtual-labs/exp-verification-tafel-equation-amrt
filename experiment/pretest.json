      "question": "An electrolytic cell:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Has a non-spontaneous chemical reaction",
        "b": "Requires application of a negative potential to make the reaction occur",
        "c": "Has a positively charged anode",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, but not complete. This is part of the characteristics of an electrolytic cell.",
        "b": "Correct, but not complete. A negative potential is required to drive the reaction.",
        "c": "Partially true, but not the complete defining feature.",
        "d": "Correct. All options A and B are true for an electrolytic cell."

      "question": "If we pass a current of 10.0 Amperes through a solution for 1 hour, how many moles of electrons are used?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "10 x 1 x 3600 / 96487",
        "b": "10 x 1 x 3600",
        "c": "10 x 1 x 3600 x 96487",
        "d": "10 x 1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Charge in coulombs divided by Faradayâ€™s constant gives moles of electrons.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This gives the charge in coulombs, not the moles.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This would give an incorrect and large value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This gives the total ampere-hours, not moles."
      },
